# Tic Tac Toe OOP

Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the most simple games in history. So why not take it up a notch and make it more dynamic using OOP.

## Installation

Make sure to have NodeJs and a node package manager installed (I personally use `yarn`)

Run:

```bash
npm i
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

- Write down your name and Symbol (X or O)
- Choose the size of your board (between 3 and 10)
- Kick the computer's fan
- Enjoy!
